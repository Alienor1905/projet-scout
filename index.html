	<h2>A little bit of history</h2>
	<p>Scouting is a worldwide youth movement founded by Robert Baden-Powell, a retired British Protestant general, in 1907 in Brownsea. Today, Scouting (including Girl Guides, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts) has over 58 million members in 217 countries and territories, of all religions and nationalities, represented by a number of Scout associations worldwide.

	Scouting is a youth movement based on learning values such as solidarity, mutual aid and respect. Its aim is to help young people form their character and build their personality, while contributing to their physical, mental and spiritual development. To achieve this objective, scouting relies on practical activities in nature, as well as indoor activities designed more for intellectual learning. Scouting is based on a law and a promise, and generally has a religious or spiritual dimension.
